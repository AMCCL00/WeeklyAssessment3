        we would want to do that.

        /* ANSWER QUESTION HERE:
        Making this class abstract lets us store methods that are declared but not used in it and it lets us make things
        that we can access in other classes so that the program is a lot cleaner and easier for other people to read and
        understand what we are doing in our code by making everything separate.
